# Final Project

## Part 1 - Proposal

* **Section 1: Overview**  
  Invent a feature, or features, you would like to add to the app. Describe the
  general functionality you are picturing here. Try not to go too overboard.
  Keep the scope fairly small and focused.
* **Section 2: Unknowns**  
  Describe the parts of your feature you are not familiar with. For example, if you
  want to allow a user to attach an uploaded file to a blog post, but you've
  never dealt with file uploads to a web server before, mention that in this
  section.
* **Section 3: Security**  
  Describe any security concerns you anticipate.
  * How will you prevent users from accessing the resources of other users?
  * What kind of roles will you need to add?

As you work on your project, write about the problems you came across and how
you fixed or worked around them.

You'll hand this in to me after you present.

## Part 3 - Present

Present your project to the class.

* Make a video of your feature in action and describe what's going on to the class.
* Do a live demo of your app and describe what's going on to the class.
